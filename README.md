# Frontend Mentor - Manage landing page

## Overwiev

This repository holds my solution to the [Manage landing page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/manage-landing-page-SLXqC6P5). Frontend Mentor challenges are frontend exercices where you can test yourself, improve your coding or generally try new things while building realistic projects.

## The challenge

The challenge here was to build, as usual, a website with an optimal layout depending on the user's device's screen size and enable hover states for all interactive elements. Apart from that there was a slider to build and an imput field that informs when the input is empty or the addres is screwed up.

## How it went

I decided to practice typescript while completing this challenge, which overall wasn't a bad idea since it helps you track and eliminate any mistakes faster. And because it was also my first time making a slider lots of mistakes were inevitable. All in all, I must say I had fun but I feel like the slider is still a bit awkward and could be improved, at least for the desktop version. I know curiosity is driving you crazy, so do yourself a favour and see my work [here](https://frontendmentor-manage-page.vercel.app/)
